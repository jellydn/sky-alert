## Thu Feb 19 11:12:34 +08 2026 - US-001
- Initialized TypeScript project with grammy, drizzle-orm, and better-sqlite3
- Created database schema with three tables: flights, tracked_flights, status_changes
- Set up Drizzle ORM configuration and generated migrations
- Database migrations run successfully with all tables created
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: package.json, tsconfig.json, drizzle.config.ts, src/db/schema.ts, src/db/index.ts, src/index.ts, .env.example, .gitignore
**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Drizzle Kit uses "dialect: 'sqlite'" instead of "driver" in config
- Migrations are generated in drizzle/ directory and should be committed
- SQLite database file is created in data/ directory on first migration
