## Thu Feb 19 11:12:34 +08 2026 - US-001
- Initialized TypeScript project with grammy, drizzle-orm, and better-sqlite3
- Created database schema with three tables: flights, tracked_flights, status_changes
- Set up Drizzle ORM configuration and generated migrations
- Database migrations run successfully with all tables created
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: package.json, tsconfig.json, drizzle.config.ts, src/db/schema.ts, src/db/index.ts, src/index.ts, .env.example, .gitignore
**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Drizzle Kit uses "dialect: 'sqlite'" instead of "driver" in config
- Migrations are generated in drizzle/ directory and should be committed
- SQLite database file is created in data/ directory on first migration

## Thu Feb 19 11:15:42 +08 2026 - US-002
- Set up Telegram bot using grammY framework
- Implemented /start command with welcome message
- Implemented /help command with list of available commands
- Bot connects to Telegram using BOT_TOKEN env variable
- Bot uses long polling (default grammY behavior)
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: src/bot/index.ts, src/index.ts
**Learnings for future iterations:**
- grammY's auto-quote middleware package doesn't exist or has different name - skip for now
- Bot needs to be started after database connection is verified
- grammY uses ctx.reply() with parse_mode for formatted messages
